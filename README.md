# Bad Flappy Bird
<img src="./icon.png" width="200px">

A very very very simple version of flappy bird.<br>
This project was made for testing the new godot engine!
I didn't put much effort into recreating the original game, so I gave it my own touch!

There is a MacOS download link available by the releases.<br>
For windows, you need to compile it yourself!

### This is not maintained anymore!
You can still run the app, but I'm not developing it anymore!
